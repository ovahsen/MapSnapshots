# Introduction

The map display APIs provides a tool to generate map image of a location. We are going to wrap this API call to generate a specific area with a zoom level and perhaps some other features, create the image and return it as file. 

Useful for websites who need to generate a specific location.

This demo is written with Python 3.7
